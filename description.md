> Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code; too little and expressiveness is endangered.
Guido von Rossum

Python is a great programming language for programmers of all experience levels.
It is well-known and widely used in the software industry for its English-like syntax and elegant simplicity.
Developers use Python to design websites, analyze data, and build applications.

We built [Pythonroom](https://pythonroom.com) to make it easier to introduce Python in a classroom setting. Pythonroom has over one hundred
free problems and lessons, allows you to write and run code entirely through the web browser, and monitors student progress in real time.

The examples in this course use the native Python interpreter to explore the full range of possibilities in using Python on a computer.
