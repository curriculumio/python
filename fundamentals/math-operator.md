For example, the `+` operator combines two numbers into a single number that represents their sum. This process by which
a computer determines a new result is called **evaluation**.

Python has several built-in math operators:

- `-` operator for subtraction
- `*` operator for multiplication
- `/` operator for division
- `**` for exponentiation

Notice in the example on the right, `13 / 5` produced `2`, while `13.0 / 5.0` produced the correct result of `2.6`.
This is because dividing integers produces an integer result. If we wanted the precise value (a `float`), one or both of the
initial values needs to be a `float`.

!!!In Python 3, the `//` operator was introduced for "floor division", and the `/` operator produces a precise value for both `int`s and `float`s.
