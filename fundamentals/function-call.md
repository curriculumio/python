A function is *called* by adding a pair of parentheses after the function name. For example, the `print` function is a known action that the computer can perform to display text output, and we can call it with `print()`.

The information between the parentheses, commonly referred to as the function's **input**, is the value that should be printed out. If we called `print()` with no inputs, nothing will print out. When we perform `print("hello")`, we telling the `print` function to perform its action with the specific information `"hello"`.

Different functions use their inputs in different ways. Try *calling* the `abs` function with a number, and the `input` function with a string.
