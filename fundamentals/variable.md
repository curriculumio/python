A variable's name cannot contain spaces or punctuation (except for underscore `_` characters). It can contain numbers, but cannot start with one.

To store a value in a variable, use the `=` operator. The value on the right side of the `=` is stored in the variable on the left, in a process known as
**assigning** to the variable.

To retrieve the value stored in a variable, write its name. For example, we can store integers in a `width` and `height` variable, then calculate the area
in a future instruction by evaluating `width * height`.

> Variables allow us to store values to use in other instructions of our programs.
